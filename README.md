## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App: Discord
  - Sidebar Design
  - The "Person is texting..." feature
App: Instagram
  - Camera Icon on side of chats to take quick pictures
  - The outside highlight of stories to signify normal story, friends story, or no story
App: Reddit
  - How comments are organized
  - Despite only using black, sections are still easily defined
App: Messages/iMessage
  - The Simplicity of the layout (and how it doesn't force you to use newer features)
  - The use of bitmojis
  - How groupchats are organized and how admin access works on it (far better than Discord or Instagram)

App Idea: As someone that cooks a fair amount, I have not found an app that allows you to effectgively store recipes (notes is the one I use right now). That app I would develop would allow me to effectively store recipes, as well as publish them and allow others to take from my recipe and edit it (in their own copy). This would allow for recipe searching, aswell as making. I would also like to implement a like/dislike feature to help show which recipes are good, and include the normal trending, most popular, and recent tabs to see unique recipes.

## Notes

App was overall very easy to make, as documentation and implementation was very intuitive. Biggest roadbump was getting used to the UI, which although not bad, is very different to most IDE'S I use. Only other technical problem I had was with programming the slider, which was slightly confusing, as I did not get how to make the label change based on the sliders movement.
